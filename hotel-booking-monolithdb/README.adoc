== Data Generator
The data generator is a Java application that generates a Postgres schema DDL and insert statements. The data generator code is located in the *+data-generator+* folder here:

https://github.com/mcouliba/hotel-booking

To generate the DDL file, execute the *+com.redhat.hotelbooking.datagen.DataModelGenerator+* class. The generator outputs a file called *+hotel-booking.ddl+* which is located in the *+resources/generated+*
folder. 

There are settings in the code that control the generated DDL. Although these settings currently can only be set by changing the code, it would not be hard to also be able to set these via a command-line argument.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

There are settings in two different places:

. DataModelGenerator - these settings control which DDL statements.
. DataProvider - these settings control how many insert statements are generated and set min/max values of the generated data.
